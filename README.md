- 👋 Hi, I’m @Flogman88
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development. Turning ideas into solutions that can be used on mobiles initially and then more complex applications that can be delivered as software as a service (SaaS). Many users that belong to many tenants (Corporates) will logon and use my developments I hope.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and everything else that I need for full stack development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python full stack but please note that I am a raw beginner as at April 2022
- 📫 How to reach me busproj2020@outlook.com
